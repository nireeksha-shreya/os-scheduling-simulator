# OS Scheduling Simulator

A Python-based simulation of fundamental CPU scheduling algorithms used in Operating Systems.

## Implemented Algorithms

- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF - Non Preemptive)
- Round Robin (RR)

## Concepts Covered

- Process scheduling
- Waiting time calculation
- Turnaround time calculation
- Time quantum handling
- Algorithm comparison

## File Structure

- scheduling.py → Contains implementations of FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin

## How to Run

```bash
python scheduling.py
